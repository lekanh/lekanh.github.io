## If I can read it, it's fine!
When I first began programming, with great importance my professor had told us code formatting matters. I did not know any code etiquette at that time so I was thinking, why does it matter? It is my code, if I can read it, is that not fine? I mean, I am the one who is going to run it, who is going to read it, so why does it matter if it is readable to anyone else? Then we were introduced to group projects. It had opened my eyes to how critical it is for code to be readable. Not only is code readability important, but also the efficiency of the program. This is why when ESLint was introduced for IntelliJ, I did not find it to be an issue. It provides not only realtime corrections but also utimately overall organized codes. However, the enabling of ESLint is a bit inconvenient. 

## Practicality Coding Standards
By using coding standards, providing sets of guidelines, for optimal programming styles to follow while writing code, the practicality of coding standards is most definitely apparent. Having the realtime corrections happpening allows the programmer to check for errors while they progress through their code. Imagine having to go back every time to check for a runtime error which can easily be detected by the coding standard checkup. I think it provides much more efficiency for both coding and time. It allows the programmer to learn more about the language they are using, as the coding standard will point out ways the programmer can improve their code.

## Take Advantage
