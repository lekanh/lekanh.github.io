## Ask Questions

Quite often, there are instructors who welcome questions, particularly for courses which are difficult to grasps. To acknowledge that the material is not easy to comphrend, they open discussions on the topic with: 
> "There are no dumb questions, don't be afraid to ask. You'll find that not only yourself but also your classmates with benefit from your questions."
Quote break.
So? Is there really no such thing as dumb questions? I have been wondering about this question too throughout my educational career. I am not one to ask questions in a classroom I am uncomfortable and unfamiliar in. This puts a restriction on my potential to get answers when a question pops into my head when I stumble upon information I can process quickly enough. Following the assumption of the existence of dumb questions, there has to be smart questions too then.
