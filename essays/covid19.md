## Online courses are a Real PAIN
Even before COVID-19 happened and quarantine was implemented, I was already struggling with flipped classroom courses, ie ICS 314 and (especially) ICS 311. I abhor having to study materials on my own, because not only do I have limited motivation for courses I already know I am going to struggle in, but the fact that I must teach myself materials AND be able to understand it.. this semester was already challenging with or without a pandemic. With the transition of courses going online I can not, and frankly, do not know how I can express enough how even more stressed out I am. Although before quarantine happened I did complain about how much time I spent on campus, from 8 AM to late evening almost weekday, now however, I regret those complaints. I had taken it all for granted. I miss seeing and interacting with my friends, I miss stressing out on the ICS 311 quizzes in ICSpace with my study group. Not to mention, I struggle keeping up with my assignments for almost all of my courses now that it is online, rather than having a reminder in person, I have to look if I have assignments due.

## Mental and Physical Health
As I have mentioned above, quarantine has very much so restricted my socialization time. I would like to say that college had helped me a lot with my introvertedness. I got to meet new people and create new friendships. The exposure and interactions with my friends really helped and had great benefits on my mental health, knowing I'm not struggling alone, having face to face interactions, and be more socialable with others. Now I am stuck alone in my room because I rarely interact with my family. In addition, as I lack of a desk and chair, as I have spent so much time on campus there was no need of it at home, I spend most of my time awake in bed. The routine of waking up at 7 and going to campus, walking around to my classes and ICSpace, and eating my meals has been completely abolished by quarantine. I can physcially feel the sedentary lifestyle setting in and deteriorating my physical health, which I am completely aware is happening but the lack of motivation and (really) there is no reason to get up as everything can be done (theoretically) on my laptop, I can just simply reach for my laptop. I would wake up late if I don't have a ZOOM meeting, I skip breakfast and lunch, I rarely walk, and I stay up late. Wow, typing that out really made me realize how unhealthy my lifestyle has changed in this past month.

## The Future
I really hope that I will start realizing how detrimental this slippery slope for my health I am on can get. There is no one to blame but myself, I could've handled this transition better had I been more efficient. I know that I could do some exercises and be more productive with my academics, but there is no external force which is pushing me. I mean I still got the rest of the year to get productive, or at least until the pandemic blows over. I just have to trudge through my coursework and ZOOM my friends for now. One bright side of this I did not see coming was Movie Nights with my friends where we join in one Discord stream and watch a movie together. I really hope the quarantine does as it should and COVID 19 is no more because I can not take it anymore. I may be a shut-in but that is only by choice, however if it is forced upon me, well, I don't feel like it.
