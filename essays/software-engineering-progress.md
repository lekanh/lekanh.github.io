This course has taught me a lot more than I had expected when I clicked register. Naively I thought there is not much more to software engineering than web development right? I mean hardware engineering is straight forwardly just those two words, engineering hardware. Hahah. But in complete honestly, what I took away from this couse is more than how to make a pretty user interface for people to have an easier time on a website. 

## Coding Standards
For starters I greatly agree with having coding standards, especically when working in a group project setting. As when working in a group project, problems and issues are divided among group members, there are bound to be functions and methods that overlap. Being able to read and understand code that is necessary for your part of the project in order to reach the completion of a project is absolutely crucial. If the code is unreadable as it is ill formatted, the other members may not be able to utilize it. Using a set format to which our codes could abide to allows a smooth path for everyone involved.

## Ethics in Software Engineering
As I was inexperienced with software engineering, I was not very aware of the topic of ethnics in regards to software engineering let alone thought of the implications and explicit issues that it covers. However, upon learning and further research, ethnics is a considerable subject matter for software engineering. As programmers have quite an immense scope of capacity in aquiring information, be it with or with out the discretion of the users. This is where ethnics is added into the conversation, whether the action of the codes the programmer created has malicious intentions, such that it infringes the user's privacy.

## Design Patterns
Again, as I lack experience in software engineering, or rather Computer Science in general, I was never well informed about the recurrency of problems and how there are various problems which could be solved using the same structure as another problem which has already been solved before. Design patterns are basic solution structures that are applicable to differing problems. Being able to utilize these design patterns, solutions are easier and faster to attain as we have a base foundation that needs some tweaking to apply to our problem.
