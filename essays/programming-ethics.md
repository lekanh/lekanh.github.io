## Coding Ethics
I never thought much about ethics in the scope of programming and coding. There was not much of a right or wrong that I placed in how coding could affect the world. Albeit, the programs which I have made so far never had to be questioned of its ethicality, whether it is morally right or wrong; I mean what could be so harmful about how to convert Fahrenheit to Celcisus or vice versa? Or recreating a game that barely works. However, I realize now that there is so much ethics involved in the scope of software engineering. I suppose it may be as I never had malicious intentions with my programming path, I just want to create games or fun programs. The fact that people have malicious intentions and can utilize software engineering as a means to do harm completely slipped my mind.

## A Case Study in Privacy
I spend a lot of time fumbling around with Google Street View, whether it was for class or just for fun. I never thought much about it, I mean there is not much harm in looking at streets is there? It is in fact all public, there no invasion of privacy right? Looking at the street on StreetView is just like me standing at the street but rather than physically being there, I am virtually experiencing it. There is no harm! However there are not only underlining but also overlining matters in this. It was revealed in 2010 as a scandal for Google StreetView, 3 years after its launch, that the softwares used for the StreetView data had also only only collected but also had stored personal information of the bypassing residents.
