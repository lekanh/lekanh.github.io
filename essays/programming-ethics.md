## Coding Ethics
I never thought much about ethics in the scope of programming and coding. There was not much of a right or wrong that I placed in how coding could affect the world. Albeit, the programs which I have made so far never had to be questioned of its ethicality, whether it is morally right or wrong; I mean what could be so harmful about how to convert Fahrenheit to Celcisus or vice versa? Or recreating a game that barely works. However, I realize now that there is so much ethics involved in the scope of software engineering.
