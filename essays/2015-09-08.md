## Why am I here?
My interests in software engineering stemmed from the video game Star Trek: Bridge Crew. At first, I was not sure as to which part I was more intrigued by, the hardware or the software, whether it was the VR headset or the gameplay that was more compelling (I had sided with the hardware side). So I began my college career in Computer Engineering. However, after taking EE160, Programming for Engineers in C, that realized I enjoyed the software aspect also, specifically, I was curious in the development of the gameplay and user interfacings. So I had switched to Computer Science.

## What did I gain?
To be quite honest, I had no idea what I wanted to major in when I began to think about my college career, I had started with Anthropology. So I am really thankful that I had stumbled upon the game. Even though I was going in completely blankslate into the major, I find myself enjoying most of my classes and the materials, experiences and knowledge I acquire and learned.
