## Another Language to Learn?

Back in the early 2010s, blogs were popping, and with that craze themed blogs were even more so. In my eyes, people who knew or learnt how to code HTML had all the power. They were able to create such beautiful and aesthetically pleasing themes, I would change my blog every other week, my bookmarks folder would continuously grow as I stumble upon different themes. As curious and eager to learn as I was, I looked into it as I wanted to make a few changes to the theme, and boy was it a surprise to me how difficult and complex it was. There were so many components and elements to be aware of. I was shocked, looking at the source codes of the themes that I had loved I was completely overwhelmed. I mean, where do I even start to look at? What is the head or body? Of what? I was so confused I never went back to it again. Until now, learning HTML and CSS as I learn how to build a website from the foundations was pretty eye opening. Albeit the website looks like it was the barebones of the web.. I was still proud of my work! But even these barebones are time consuming. So when Semantic UI was introduced, when I found out I could be using already built libraries instead of making my own. Wow, this was like transitioning from walking to taking a bus. But is it worth it to learn a whole new language library?

## Usefulness of UI Frameworks

There are pros and cons to UI Frameworks. On one hand it allows much faster implementation of HTML and CSS. To begin with, to be quite honest.. RAW HTML and CSS... not very nice looking. And what could have taken me 20 minutes to create could be done in under 5 minutes. I would not have to go through each aspect of what I want as it is already built and provided in a library. However, on the other hand, this means I must be aware of the documentation and components of the library. In addition, at times in which the library's classes components and/or elements do not match with what I want. But this can be easily countered by overriding; which in my point of view is much more efficient, it seems much faster to override a piece of information rather than recreating the entirety, just so I can have one specified element the way I want it. So despite the hurdles UI Frameworks may have, in the long run, I feel its' usefulness overweigh its disadvantageous.
