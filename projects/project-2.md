Psydodgeball was my first Java project. I worked on it by myself so I was the only one responsible for the codes. I used object-oriented programming and created different classes to specify each Pokeball's speed and direction. The player uses WASD to move around the game screen. The challenges I had were figuring out the calculations for the speed of the Pokeballs.
