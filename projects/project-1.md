This minigame utilizies the only two keys, 'w' and 'a', allowing the player to move left and right. The more fruits caught in the basket the more points is earned. There are "golden fruits" which have a higher worth than the normal ones. However, the game provides 6 lives, which can be taken away by a bee, which detects where the player is. 

This project was implemented with Java and EZGraphics. I found Java to be a bit easier of a language to learn. However, I do believe because my prior knowledge of C, I was able to catch on to Java much easier and faster. However, the differences between C and Java, with pointers and classes, was a hurdle. Using the object-oriented language to create this minigame allowed me to further understand the concept. Through this project, I also learned how to be a more effective communicator as we did not have a large group. This enabled me to realize my limitations.
